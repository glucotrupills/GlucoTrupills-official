How Does GlucoTru Work?
-----------------------

GlucoTru reduces blood sugar levels in several ways. Firstly, it helps to increase insulin sensitivity, which means that the body is able to use insulin more effectively, which reduces blood sugar levels. This can help to prevent glucose from being stored in the body as fat, reducing the risk of developing type 2 diabetes.

Additionally, the natural ingredients like licorice root and juniper berries in GlucoTru diabetic formula have been shown to reduce glucose absorption in the intestines, helping to keep blood glucose levels under control and lower blood sugar levels.

Indeed, a healthy blood sugar level in your body will ensure that your entire mechanism is working without any issues.

What Are The GlucoTru Ingredients That Make The Supplement Work?
----------------------------------------------------------------

**Here is an overview of the core ingredients in GlucoTru that make the supplement work:**

### Juniper Berries

The primary active components that promote proper blood sugar levels when consuming juniper berries are the phenolic acids and flavonoids contained within them. These compounds play a key role in helping the body maintain healthy levels of insulin by regulating glucose absorption from the small intestines into the bloodstream.

Additionally, these compounds also have antioxidant properties that protect against cell damage from free radical molecules, which helps further reduce inflammation often triggered by high blood sugar levels.

### Licorice Root

Licorice root contains numerous compounds which are believed to be responsible for its medicinal properties. These include glycyrrhizin, glabridin, liquiritin, glabrolide, and 7-hydroxy guaiacol. Some of these compounds have pharmacological effects on various organs in the body; however, one of the main uses of licorice is to treat diabetes by regulating blood glucose levels.

It has been observed that glycyrrhizin can inhibit a key enzyme involved in controlling blood glucose levels – sodium/glucose cotransporter (SGLT2 inhibitor). By blocking SGLT2, it decreases the reuptake of glucose from the patient's small intestine into the bloodstream.

### Chromium

Chromium helps to facilitate the action of insulin on cells by binding with insulin receptors. Insulin is a hormone that helps to move glucose into cells so it can be used for energy production. Without enough chromium present in the body, the body has difficulty using glucose properly, resulting in high levels of glucose remaining in the bloodstream and leading to diabetes.

The active components of chromium are known collectively as trivalent chromium or “chromatic” complex, which consists of three elements: chromium (III), cobalt (II), and aluminum (IV).

Each of these elements has its own specific function within this complex, but all work together to help regulate blood glucose levels by binding with insulin receptors, thus helping to move glucose into cells so they can be used for energy production.

### Manganese

Manganese helps regulate both the uptake and release of sugar from cells by influencing the activity of metabolic enzymes responsible for glucose transport into and out of cells. Manganese has been shown to be effective in inhibiting inflammation caused by high blood sugar levels and increased sensitivity to insulin.

The active components involved in manganese-dependent regulation of blood glucose include various enzymes such as manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), pyruvate carboxylase, mitochondrial glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (mGAPDH), along with several other enzyme systems.

These specific metabolic enzymes are essential for maintaining the normal functioning of the endocrine system and the proper storage of glucose within cells.

### Zinc

Zinc is an essential mineral that plays a key role in regulating blood glucose levels. It helps to maintain the balance of insulin and glucagon, two hormones that are responsible for controlling the amount of sugar in the bloodstream. Zinc also helps to increase the sensitivity of cells to insulin, allowing them to absorb more glucose from the bloodstream. Additionally, zinc helps to reduce inflammation in the body which can lead to increased blood sugar levels.

Zinc also helps to regulate carbohydrate metabolism by increasing the activity of enzymes involved in breaking down carbohydrates into glucose molecules. This process is important for maintaining normal blood sugar levels as it ensures that glucose is available for energy production and storage. Zinc also helps to prevent fat accumulation in cells by inhibiting lipogenesis, or fat production.

Finally, zinc has been shown to help reduce oxidative stress, which can lead to elevated blood sugar levels. Oxidative stress occurs when there is an imbalance between free radicals and antioxidants in the body, leading to cell damage and inflammation. By reducing oxidative stress, zinc can help keep blood sugar levels within a healthy range.

### Biotin

Biotin is a member of the B-group of vitamins and is important for normal growth, functioning of enzymes, and metabolism. It is also vital for keeping your skin healthy and maintaining a strong immune system.

Biotin plays a key role in regulating glucose levels by ensuring that sugar molecules that enter the bloodstream from food are broken down properly into usable energy. It helps to transport glucose across cell membranes more efficiently, which can result in better control over blood sugar levels and reduce the risk of diabetes or hypoglycemia (low blood sugar).

### Cinnamon

Cinnamon has powerful antioxidant properties and therefore helps improve insulin sensitivity. It works by helping your body use insulin more efficiently, which helps reduce blood sugar levels in diabetes patients as well as those without diabetes whose blood sugar may be elevated.

The active ingredients in cinnamon include cinnamaldehyde, cinnamic acid, eugenol, beta-caryophyllene, and coumarin — all of which are thought to be partially responsible for the positive effects on glucose levels.

### Gymnema Sylvestre

Gymnema Sylvestre helps to block out glucose absorption and encourages the breakdown of complex carbohydrates into smaller molecules. The compounds in Gymnema Sylvestre act on the taste receptors in our mouth, blocking out sweet tastes and assisting with weight loss.

Additionally, Gymnema Sylvestre helps to regulate insulin secretion from beta cells of islets (small clusters) of Langerhans located in the pancreas.

Animal studies have shown that when placed on diabetes-induced mice, Gymnema Sylvestre helped significantly reduce blood sugar levels by decreasing glucose absorption and increasing insulin synthesis and secretion.

What Are The Scientific Studies Backing GlucoTru For Reducing Blood Glucose Levels?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Human trials have yielded positive results concerning metabolic control in type 2 diabetics when taking 400mg of Gymnema Sylvestre per day 3x times a day before meals over an eight-week period.

Patents taking Gymnema Sylvestre noticed a significant decrease in A1C%, fasting glucose, and postprandial (glucose taken after having a meal) glucose concentrations had plummeted compared with those given placebos or treated only with conventional antidiabetes treatments.

Other research suggests that biotin supplements may improve insulin sensitivity and decrease fasting blood sugar levels in type-2 diabetics who took doses ranging from 2mg a day to 20mg a day spread out over 3 doses per day over 8 weeks. Results showed more significant decreases when large doses of 20 mg were taken daily.

A 2012 study published in the journal Food and Chemical Toxicology found that glycyrrhizin and glycyrrhetinic acid, two compounds naturally derived from licorice root, play a role in regulating blood sugar levels. The study concluded that the consumption of licorice can provide “potent effects on glucose metabolism.”

This finding was reinforced by a 2014 study conducted by the University Hospital Zurich, which compared the effect of increased intake of soft drinks sweetened with fructose versus glucose on glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity.

The results showed that participants who consumed beverages sweetened with licorice extract had significantly lower fasting plasma glucose concentrations than those drinking beverages sweetened with fructose or glucose alone.

A number of studies conducted on humans and animals have demonstrated that juniper berries also can help to lower blood glucose levels in people suffering from type 2 diabetes. For instance, one study involved 33 human participants who consumed either a placebo or an extract from juniper berries daily for eight weeks. At the end of the study period, those taking the extract had significantly lower glucose concentrations at both fasting and after eating compared to those in the placebo group.
